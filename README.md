### Movie Recommendation System Using KNN Collaborative Filtering (MovieLens Dataset)

### Overview:
This project builds a movie recommendation system using k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) collaborative filtering on the MovieLens dataset. Prior to implementing KNN, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the dataset. The system uses cosine similarity based on a pivot table to recommend movies.

### Steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed the dataset to understand the ratings distribution, identified popular movies, and studied user behavior.

2. Cosine Similarity Calculation:

Constructed a pivot table and computed cosine similarity between users or movies.

3. Recommendation Generation:

Implemented KNN to generate movie recommendations based on similarity scores.

### Results:

The KNN model generates accurate movie recommendations using cosine similarity based on insights gained from EDA.
